      <p>“I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.”</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>We exist to provide Christ-centered transitional housing with individualized support for women (and their children) on their paths to recovery and independent, sustainable living.</p>
    <p>We are a transition home. What we are not:</p>
    <ul class="default-ul">
      <li>A rescue home</li>
      <li>An in-house treatment facility</li>
      <li>A home only for trafficked victims</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>Our goal is four-fold:</h2>
    <ul class="default-ul">
      <li><strong>Greater Connection:</strong> We seek to connect each woman with the Lord Jesus Christ and the right people to support her personal goals.</li>
      <li><strong>Greater Competency:</strong> We seek to guide each woman towards professional, domestic and personal competency.</li>
      <li><strong>Greater Character:</strong> We seek to support and encourage each woman in her chosen personal character development.</li>
      <li><strong>Greater Confidence:</strong> We seek to build up each woman’s self-worth by teaching her true identity in Christ.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How can I make a difference?</h2>
    <h3>Be a Mentor</h3>
    <p>Have you been told you are a great friend? Then you could mentor a woman who is working to make changes in her life but needs someone to come alongside her and encourage her. You will share your knowledge in areas she is lacking, model Christian living, and most importantly be a trustworthy listener. The study of God’s Word together and holding each other accountable would likely be a part of this relationship.  Mentoring would be an ongoing relationship with a time commitment of at least one hour each week (Female mentors only).</p>

    <h3>Be a House Mom</h3>
    <p>Each home will have a live-in House Mom, but we need extra “moms” to be there during the times when she is not in the home. Some moms will be needed on a consistent basis. Others are needed to cover those unexpected times.</p>
    <p>As a house mom, you are there to make sure the residents are following the house rules (just like you do in your own household). The rules are simple, and everyone will know them; but sometimes there will need to be a “mom” to remind and encourage adherence to the rules. House Moms may need to ensure that the women are fulfilling their domestic chores and other responsibilities. A “mom” is also someone who is at home when one comes home from a long day. She is the one who is there to celebrate with you and encourage you as you live each day.</p>
    <p>Contact us if this interests you and we’ll discuss if this position would be the right fit for you. Before beginning as a “mom” we will be sure to provide you with our various training materials.</p>

    <h3>Prayer Support</h3>
    <p>This ministry is filled with front-line spiritual battles and needs to be bathed in continual prayer for both those serving and our residents! Contact us if you desire to be on our prayer team and we’ll email you our specific and ongoing prayer requests.</p>

    <h3>Be a Financial Contributor</h3>
    <p>Branch15 is the name of our 501C3 non-profit organization that operates through generous contributions. Your tax-deductible gift will go to cover housing and various ministry expenses, a few house staffing positions, and hopefully extend to acquiring more homes as we anticipate a need for expansion. We plan to open our 2nd and 3rd home in April 2014! We are anticipating the first annual fiscal budget to be in the $90,000-$100,000 range.</p>

    <h3>Be an Employer</h3>
    <p>Do you have a job to offer? Are you willing to take a risk on a woman who has been out of work for a while or whose background-check might be a little sketchy? Would you be willing to give a woman a starting point to get back to work earning an income to support herself and possibly her family? Employment is a huge step towards the freedom these women are seeking, yet is very difficult without someone believing in them.</p>

    <h3>Be an Advocate</h3>
    <p>Are you a licensed professional who would be willing to volunteer your services to a woman in transition?</p>
    <p>Here’s a list of potential needs: Legal aid, Christian Counseling/Therapy, Psychiatry, Medical, Dental, Vision, Chiropractic care, etc.</p>

    <h3>Provide your Salon or Spa service</h3>
    <p>Is this your area of expertise? We want each woman at The Branch to know that she is precious and of great value! Some of our women have never had hair, nails or makeup done by a professional. A trip to a hair salon may boost her self-confidence before a job interview or mark a time of celebration.</p>

    <h3>Provide Maintenance Help</h3>
    <p>Do you enjoy keeping your home in good repair? Would you be willing to work on our  “Honey-Do List”?  The home is in good repair but there are a few things we need. We do have a great lead volunteer in this area but if you would be willing to step in and help him when it calls for more hands, please let us know.</p>

    <h3>Provide Lawn Care</h3>
    <p>The lawns are small but will need mowing each week during the warmer months. Would you be willing to help with this task?</p>

    <h3>Future Home Directors and Live-in House Moms</h3>
    <p>As God expands our ministry to reach more women in new Branch homes, we will be looking for new House Directors and Live-in House Moms as well as Day Moms.</p>
